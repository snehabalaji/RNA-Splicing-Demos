## A Helpful Guide to RNA Splicing Technologies

*A beginner’s step-by-step guide to using current RNA Splicing prediction technologies (Pangolin, MTSplice and SpliceAI).* 

## A Bit of An Introduction

Hi everyone! My name is Sneha Balaji and I’m a second year [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/)  student at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Canada! This summer I had the opportunity to intern at [King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi](https://www.kmutt.ac.th/en/) (KMUTT) in Bangkok, Thailand. 

Over the course of my summer, my research mainly focused on RNA splicing, specifically about the various prediction technologies in this ever-growing field. As someone who has freshly finished first year and with minimal technical expertise, I found it quite the challenge to understand and effectively use these technologies. So, I decided to create this blog so that individuals with less technical backgrounds can have an easier time accessing and using these technologies. 

*Note: these tutorials will primarily focus on using the technologies in a Google Collab environment.* 

This blog will focus on three current technologies in particular: Pangolin, MTSplice and SpliceAI. A bit about these technologies:

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/snehabalaji/RNA-Splicing-Demos/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
